# ✍️ Siamese CNN for Signature Verification using Deep Learning

A deep learning project that verifies whether two handwritten signatures belong to the same person using a **Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture.  
Trained and evaluated on the [**Kaggle Signature Verification Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robinreni/signature-verification-dataset).

##  Overview

Signature verification is a challenging problem in biometric authentication.  
This project implements a **Siamese ResNet-18 CNN** that learns feature embeddings of signatures and predicts whether a given pair is **genuine (same person)** or **forged (different person)**.
